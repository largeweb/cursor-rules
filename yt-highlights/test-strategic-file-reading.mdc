# Strategic File Reading Rule

## When to Apply
Use this rule when reading and analyzing code files to avoid information overload and maintain focus on the relevant workflow.

## Core Principles

### Chunk-Based Reading Strategy
- **Never read entire large files at once** unless specifically requested by user
- Start with first 50-100 lines to understand structure and imports
- Read key functions/methods identified from initial scan
- Read ending if file has important exports or summary logic

### File Size Guidelines
- **Small files (< 100 lines)**: Read entirely
- **Medium files (100-300 lines)**: Read in 2-3 strategic chunks
- **Large files (300+ lines)**: Read beginning, specific functions, and ending
- **Massive files (1000+ lines)**: Focus only on specific functions mentioned in workflow

### Information Extraction Focus
For each file reading session, extract ONLY:
1. **Purpose**: What does this file/function do in the workflow?
2. **Inputs**: What data does it receive?
3. **Processing**: Key logic or transformations (high-level only)
4. **Outputs**: What does it return or trigger next?
5. **Side Effects**: Any database writes, API calls, or async operations

### Summarization Template
Always follow this format after reading a file:
