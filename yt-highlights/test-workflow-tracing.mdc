# Workflow Tracing Analysis Rule

## When to Apply
Use this rule when a user asks you to understand, analyze, or explain a workflow, process, or feature flow within a codebase.

## Core Methodology

### Step 1: Identify Entry Point
- Ask user to clarify the entry point if not obvious (e.g., API endpoint, UI component, command)
- Use `grep_search` or `file_search` to locate the entry point if needed
- For web apps: look for route handlers, event handlers, or command processors
- For Discord bots: look for command handlers or webhook endpoints

### Step 2: Read and Summarize Entry Point
- Use `read_file` to examine the entry point file (start with 50-100 lines)
- Create a concise summary including:
  - Primary methods/functions and their purpose
  - Key workflow steps outlined in the code
  - Outputs or next steps in the workflow
  - Important imports or dependencies

### Step 3: Follow the Workflow Chain
- Identify the next logical step from your entry point analysis
- Follow imports, function calls, or API endpoints that are called
- Read each connected file using the same summarization approach
- Build a chain of understanding: A → B → C → D

### Step 4: Strategic File Selection
- Focus ONLY on files directly involved in the workflow
- Skip configuration files, tests, utilities unless directly called
- Avoid files with names like "prompt", "config", "types" unless essential
- If a file is over 200 lines, read in strategic chunks (beginning, key functions, end)

### Step 5: Maintain Workflow Context
- After each file analysis, briefly explain how it connects to the previous step
- Note what data/state changes between steps
- Identify any background/async processes that are triggered

### Step 6: Complete Picture Summary
- Once you've traced the full workflow, provide a numbered summary
- Include all major steps from user action to final outcome
- Note any error handling or edge cases discovered
- Highlight key technologies/services involved
