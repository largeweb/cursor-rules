When implementing mobile navigation dropdowns, modals, or overlays that appear above scrolling content, always prioritize complete opacity over aesthetic transparency effects.
Core Principle: If users cannot clearly read the navigation text without distraction from underlying content, the transparency level is too high, regardless of how aesthetically pleasing the glass/blur effects appear.
Implementation Guidelines:
Use solid background colors (bg-[#exact-hex]) for mobile dropdowns instead of percentage-based opacity
Test dropdown visibility with actual page content underneath, not empty backgrounds
Reserve glass effects and transparency for decorative elements that don't contain critical text
Remember that mobile screens are smaller and text overlay issues are more noticeable
When in doubt, choose readability over visual flair - users need to navigate successfully first
Exception: Only use semi-transparent backgrounds when the underlying content is guaranteed to be minimal, dark, or when the transparency level is tested to be 95%+ opacity with real content scenarios.
