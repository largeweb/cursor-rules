Next.js-Cloudflare Pages Edge Runtime Component Separation Rule:

When working with Next.js deployed to Cloudflare Pages, strict separation must be maintained between server and client components. You cannot mix 'use client' directive with 'export const runtime = "edge"' in the same file.

For pages that need Edge Runtime:

1. Create a minimal server component (page.tsx) that:
   - Exports `export const runtime = 'edge'` at the top
   - Imports a client component for UI rendering
   - Avoids complex TypeScript interfaces for props (use simplified props or ESLint disable when necessary)
   - Extracts and passes only necessary data to the client component
   - Does NOT use 'use client' directive

2. Create a comprehensive client component that:
   - Starts with 'use client' directive
   - Handles all UI rendering
   - Handles client-side data fetching
   - Manages all state and interactivity
   - Uses proper TypeScript types for props and state
   
3. TypeScript Recommendations:
   - Avoid complex param types in page components
   - If TypeScript errors occur with page props, simplify the types or use ESLint disable comments
   - Use proper types in client components

This separation is required specifically because Cloudflare Pages uses the Edge Runtime differently than standard Next.js deployments, resulting in type conflicts when attempting to mix server and client patterns.
